<p>This Privacy Policy applies to your download, access, and/or use of Number Wings Games, whether on your computer, mobile device, or any other platform (each a "Game" and together the “Games”). It also covers our Marketing and Advertising activities on all platforms and other Services we may provide, including campaigns with influencers. This Privacy Policy also applies to any other Services we may provide related to our Games or Website, such as customer support, social media, community channels, and other websites we may operate from time to time.
